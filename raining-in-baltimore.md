   C#m        A       B           E
This circus is falling down on its knees
    C#m        A         B
The big top is crumbling down
     C#m        A         B           E
It's raining in Baltimore fifty miles east
 C#m                 A        B
Where you should be, no one's around
 
         A           E
I need a phone call
         A         E
I need a raincoat
         A         E
I need a big love
         A           E
I need a phone call
 
      C#m         A           B          E
These train conversations are passing me by
      C#m        A          B
And I don't have nothing to say
    C#m          A           B          E
You get what you pay for but I just had no,
C#m          A           B
intention, of living this way
 
         A           E
I need a phone call
         A           E
I need a plane ride
         A        E
I need a sunburn
       A         E
I need raincoat
 
B             A
And I get no answers
B                   A
And I don't get no change
B               A          E
It's raining in Baltimore, baby
C#m            A           B
But everything else is the same

       C#m          A         B           E
There's things I remember and things I forget
  C#m         A            B
I miss you I guess that I should
C#m            A            B      E
Three thousand five hundred miles away
    C#m            A             B
But what would you change if you could
 
         A          E
I need a phone call
                     A       E
Maybe I should buy a new car
                    A             E
I can always hear a freight train
            A          E
If I listen real hard
                       A           E
And I wish it wasn't a small world
                          A          E
'Cause I'm lonely for the big towns
                          A      E
I'd like to hear a little guitar
                             A         E
I think it's time to put the top down
 
         A           E
I need a phone call
         A         E
I need a raincoat
                A         E
I really need a raincoat
                       A         E
I really really need a raincoat
                              A         E
I really really really need a raincoat
                A         E
I really need a raincoat
