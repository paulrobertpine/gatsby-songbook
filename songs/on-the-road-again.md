[E]On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road ag[G#7]ain.
The life I love is makin[F#m]' music with my friends.
And I ca[A]n't wait to get on the ro[B7]ad again.[E]

[E]On the road again, going places that I've never been.[G#7]
Seein' things that I may[F#m]never see again.
And I ca[A]n't wait to get on the ro[B7]ad again.[E]

On the r[A]oad again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway[E]
We're the bes[A]t of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' o[E]ur way, and our way[B].

[E]Is on the road again, just can't wait to get on the road[G#7]again.
The life i love is makin[F#m]' music with my friends.
And I ca[A]n't wait to get on the ro[B7]ad again.[E]

[E] [G#7] [F#m] [A] [B7] [E]
[E] [G#7] [F#m] [A] [B7] [E]

On the r[A]oad again, like a band of gypsies we go down the highway[E]
We're the bes[A]t of friends, insisting that the world keep turnin' o[E]ur way, and our way[B7].

[E]Is on the road again, just can't wait to get on the road[G#7]again.
The life I love is makin[F#m]' music with my friends.
And I ca[A]n't wait to get on the ro[B7]ad again. And I[E]can't wait to get on the road again.
