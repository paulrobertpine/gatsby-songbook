[C]Jesus hangs behind the glass
[F]Above venetian doors
[G]His window box boasts crimson [Am]flowers fresh cut the [G]day be[C]fore

[C]And you couldn't find a smile
[F]If you nailed it to his face
[G]But Jesus Christ [Am]hangs his head with [G]grace

And if [F]Venice is sinking
[C]I'm going [G]under
[F]'Cause beauty's religion
And it's [C]christened me with [G]wonder[(C][-][F][-][G][-][Am][-][G)]

They come in bent-backed
Creeping 'cross the floor all dressed in black
Candles, thick as pillars, you can buy one off the floor

And the ceiling's painted gold
Mary's hair is red
The old come here to kiss their dead

And if [F]Venice is sinking
[C]I'm going [G]under
[F]'Cause beauty's religion
And it's [C]christened me with [G]wonder

[F] - [G] - [F] - [Am] - [G] - [C]


We made love on a bed
That sagged down to the floor
In a room that had a postcard on the door

Of Marini's Little Man
With an erection on a horse
It always leaves me laughing, leaves me feeling that, of course


I[F]f Venice is sinking
[C]I'm going [G]under
[F]'Cause beauty's religion
And it's [C]christened me with [G]wonder
If[F]Venice is sinking
[C]I'm going [G]under
[F]'Cause beauty's religion
And it's [C]christened me with [G]wonder
