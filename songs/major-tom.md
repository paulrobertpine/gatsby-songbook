[Em] [A]

[Em]Standing there alone, the ship is waiting.
[Am]All systems are go[D]: "are you sure?"
[Em]Control is not convinced, but the computer
[Am]Has the evidence[D]: no need to abo[C]rt.[Am]
The countdown st[Em]arts.
[Em]Watching in a trance, the crew is certain.
[Am]Nothing left to chance[D], all is working.
[Em]Trying to relax up in the capsule
[Am]"Send me up a drink"[D], jokes Major [C]Tom[Am].
The count goes[Em]on...

[Bm]Four, three, two, one
[G]Earth belo[D]w us, [Am]drifting, [C]falling.
[G]Floating [D]weightless, [Am]calling, [C]calling home..[Em].

[Em]Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit.
[Am]Stabilizers up[D], running perfect.
[Em]Starting to collect, requested data.
[Am]"What will it affect[D], when all is [C]done?"[Am]
Thinks Major [Em]Tom.
[Em]Back at ground control, there is a problem.
[Am]"Go to rockets full."[D]. Not responding.
[Em]"Hello Major Tom. Are you receiving?"
[Am]"Turn the thrusters on[D], we're standing [C]by."[Am]
There's no re[Em]ply.

[Bm]Four, three, two, one
[G]Earth belo[D]w us, [Am]drifting, [C]falling.
[G]Floating [D]weightless, [Am]calling, [C]calling home.[Em]..

[Em]Across the stratosphere, a final message:
"[Am]Give my wife my love."[D]
Then nothing [Em]more.[Am][D][C][Am]
[Em]Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning.
[Am]They don't realize[D]: he's alive.
[Em]No one understands, but Major Tom sees.
[Am]"Now the light commands[D], this is my [C]home[Am],
I'm coming [Em]home."
[G]Earth belo[D]w us, [Am]drifting, [C]falling.
[G]Floating [D]weightless, [Am]coming h[C]ome
[G]Earth belo[D]w us, [Am]drifting, [C]falling.
[G]Floating [D]weightless, [Am]coming, [C]coming
[G]ho[D]me[Am][C]
