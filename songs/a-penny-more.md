[Em]I will not [G]give you a penny [Am]more than you de[C]serve
[Em]I don't know[G] why you bother [Am]asking any[C]more
[G]All of your [C]charm couldn't [Am]make me change my [C]mind
[Em]I will not g[G]ive you a penny [Am]more than you deser[C]ve

[Em]Can't you see I'm [G]busy, I don't know [Am]why you never l[C]earn
[Em]I don't know [G]why you bother [Am]waiting any[C]more
[G]You stand in [C]line, but you'll ne[Am]ver get your [C]turn
[Em]I will not gi[G]ve you a penny [Am]more than you de[C]serve

[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go
[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go

[Em] [G] [Am] [Em] X 2

[Em]But if no[G]thing's what you [Am]want... You'll get no[C]thing more from [Em]me
[Em]And if no[G]thing's what you [Am]want... You'll get no[C]thing more from [Em]me

[Em]I will not [G]give you a penny [Am]more than you de[C]serve
[Em]I don't know [G]why you bother [Am]asking any[C]more
[G]All of your [C]charm couldn't [Am]make me change my [C]mind
[Em]I will not [G]give you a penny [Am]more than you de[C]serve

[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go
[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go

[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go
[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go

[Em] [G] [Am] [Em] X 2

[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go
[Em]Higher, [G]higher... You [Am]take me where I wanna [Em]go

[Em]Whoa, for a lo[G]ver, no one com[Am]pares to [Em]you
