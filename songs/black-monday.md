[C]Black [G]Mon[F]day is [Am]coming [G]around again
And it [C]feels [G]like a [F]friend that [Am]just won't [G]take a hint
[Dm]'Cause it's hanging me [G]up
[F]And it's hanging a[C]round
And [Am]I'm feeling far[G] too lost to [F]feel too pro[C]found
When the [Am]tone of my [G]voice is the [F]loneliest [C]sound
My [Am]heroes have [G]all become [F]pathetic [C]clowns
And I'm [Am]feeling far [G]too lost to [F]feel too pr[C]ofound

[C]My [G]friend [F]Kate, you [Am]laugh like a [G]tidal wave
[C]But "[G]Charlie don't [F]surf" on your [Am]laughter on Black [G]Mondays
[Dm]And the shadows I [G]feel are the [F]shadows in [C]me
And not [Am]even your [G]face or your [F]beautiful [C]smile
Or the [Am]curve of your [G]breasts or your [F]laughing bright [C]eyes
Could [Am]make me be[G]lieve I'm a [F]winner to[C]night
When [Am]Monday [G]morning is [F]just out of [C]sight

[Am]I know a [G]story
About a [Am]man who couldn’t [G]see past his fingertips
[Dm]To reach out and [G]touch it
Was [Dm]just too much like he [G]needs it
And [Am]I know a [G]woman
Who [Am]reached out to me and all she [G]got were my barbed-wire h[Dm]ands
And I won't be too [G]proud
If she can't [Dm]depend on me when Black Monday [G]starts coming aro[C]und

[C]My [G]friend [F]Kate, you are [Am]sad and [G]beautiful
And the [C]way [G]I [F]am has never [Am]been too [G]good for us
[Dm]'Cause I'm too blind to [G]hear, and I'm [F]too deaf to [C]see
But I [Am]still have a [G]voice that can [F]call out your [C]name
Wit[Am]h a gut full of[G] beer and a [F]head full of [C]pain
I can [Am]lie in your [G]arms and be [F]lovers [C]again
And thank [Am]God Tuesday [G]morning is [F]just hours [C]away
Thank [Am]God Tuesday [G]morning is [F]just hours [C]away

Yeah...
[Dm]Do you [G]know, I won't [F]let yo[C]u down, [F]let you [C]down?
[Dm]Rest your [G]head when I [F]come a[C]round, [F]come a[C]round
[Dm]Do you [G]know, you can [F]count on [C]me, [F]count on [C]me?
[Dm]Laugh out [G]loud, I see [F]what you [C]see, [F]what you [C]see

[Dm]Do you [G]know, I won't [F]let yo[C]u down, [F]let you [C]down?
[Dm]Rest your [G]head when I [F]come a[C]round, [F]come a[C]round
[Dm]Do you [G]know, you can [F]count on [C]me, [F]count on [C]me?
[Dm]Laugh out [G]loud, I see [F]what you [C]see, [F]what you [C]see

[Dm]Na     [G]na, na na     [F]na na [C]na,     [F]na na [C]na
[Dm]Na     [G]na, na na     [F]na na [C]na,     [F]na na [C]na
[Dm]Na     [G]na, na na     [F]na na [C]na,     [F]na na [C]na
[Dm]Na     [G]na, na na     [F]na na [C]na,     [F]na na [C]na
