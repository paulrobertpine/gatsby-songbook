[E]Dark in the city, [Esus4]night is a [E]wire, steam in the subway, the [Esus4]earth is a-[E]fire
Do do [D]doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do [E]do do
[E]Woman you want me, [Esus4]give me a [E]sign and catch me breathing even [Esus4]closer be-[E]hind
Do do [D]doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do [E]do do

[C]In touch with the [G]ground, I'm on the [F]hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I [C]sound, I'm lost in a [G]crowd and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Straddle the [C]line, in discord and [G]rhyme, I'm on the [F]hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, with juices like [G]wine, and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf[Em7]

[E]Stalked in the forest, [Esus4]too close to [E]hide, I'll be upon you by the [Esus4]moonlight [E]side
Do do [D]doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do [E]do do
[E]High blood drumming on your [Esus4]skin it's so [E]tight, you feel my heat, I'm just a [Esus4]moment be-[E]hind
Do do [D]doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do doo do, do [E]do do

[C]In touch with the [G]ground, I'm on the [F]hunt I'm after you
Scent and a [C]sound, I'm lost and I'm [G]found and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Straddle the [C]line, it's discord and [G]rhyme, I howl and I [F]whine, I'm after you
Mouth is a-[C]live, all running in-[G]side, and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf[Em7]

[Em7]Hungry like the wolf

Burning the [C]ground, I break from the [G]crowd, I'm on the [F]hunt, I'm after you
I smell like I [C]sound, I'm lost and I'm [G]found and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Straddle the [C]line, it's discord and [G]rhyme, I'm on the [F]hunt, I'm after you
Mouth is a-[C]live with juices like [G]wine and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Burning the [C]ground, I break from the [G]crowd, I'm on the [F]hunt, I'm after you
Scent and a [C]sound, I'm lost and I'm [G]found and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf
Straddle the [C]line, it's discord and [G]rhyme, I howl and I [F]whine, I'm after you
Mouth is a[C]live, all running in-[G]side, and I'm [F]hungry like the [D]wolf   (Fade)
