Verse 1

C               G            Am

Slip inside the eye of your mind

\    E              F    G

Don't you know you might find

\    C      Am G

A better place to play

C             G           Am

You said that you'd never been

\    E                  F    G

But all the things that you've seen

\    C    Am G F

Slowly fade away

Pre-Chorus

F                Fm             C

So I start a revolution from my bed

\    F                 Fm             C

'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

F                 Fm              C

Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

G

Stand up beside the fireplace

\    E7/G#

And take that look from off your face

Am             G             F         G

You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

Chorus

C  G         Am        E              F

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

\    G          C   Am G

as we're walking on by

\    C    G       Am   E

Her soul slides away,

\    F             G

but don't look back in anger

\    C   G   Am   E   F   G   C   Am G

I heard you say

Verse 2

C              G               Am

Take me to the place where you go

\    E      F      G                C    Am G

Where nobody knows, if it's night or day

C                     G           Am

Please don't put your life in the hands

\    E             F     G                    C    Am G

of a rock and roll band, who'll throw it all away

Pre-Chorus

F                     Fm             C

I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

\    F                 Fm             C

'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head

F                 Fm              C

Step outside, the summertime's in bloom

G

Stand up beside the fireplace

E7/G#

Take that look from off your face

\    Am             G             F         G

'Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

Chorus

C  G         Am        E              F

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

\    G          C   Am G

as she's walking on by

   C    G       Am   E

My soul slides away,

\    F             G

but don't look back in anger

\    C   Am G

I heard you say

C  G         Am        E              F

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

as we're walking on by

So Sally can wait, she knows it's too late

as she's walking on by

   C    G       Am

My soul slides away

But don't look back in anger

\    Fm

Don't look back in anger

\    C   G   Am   E   F   Fm               C

I heard you say                    At least not today
