[A]Trailers for [D]sale or rent,
[E]Rooms to let [A]fifty cents,
[A]No phone, no [D]pool, no pets.
[E]I ain't got no cigarettes.

Ah, but..[A]two hours of [D]pushin' broom,
Buys an...[E]eight-by-twelve [A]four-bit room.
I'm a [A]man of [D]means by no means,
[E]King of the [A]road.

[A]Third boxcar, [D]midnight train,
[E]Destination [A]Bangor, Maine.
[A]Old worn out [D]suit and shoes,
[E]I don't pay no union dues.

I smoke...[A]old stogies [D]I have found,
[E]Short, but not [A]too big around.
[A]I'm a man of [D]means by no means,
[E]King of the [A]road.

(Key change from A to Bb)

I know...[Bb]every engineer on [Eb]every train,
[F]All their children, 'n all [Bb]of their names,
And...[Bb]every handout in [Eb]every town,
And...[F]every lock that ain't locked when no one's around.

I sing...[Bb]trailers for [Eb]sale or rent,
[F]Rooms to let, [Bb]fifty cents,
[Bb]No phone, no [Eb]pool, no pets.
[F]I ain't got no cigarettes.

Ah, but, [Bb]two hours of [Eb]pushin' broom,
Buys an [F]eight by twelve [Bb]four-bit room.
I'm a...[Bb]man of [Eb]means by no means,
[F]King of the [Bb]road.
