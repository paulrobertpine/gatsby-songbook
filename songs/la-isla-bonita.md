Capo 4th fret

|[Am]/ /[G]/ /|[Am]/ / / / | x4

[Am]Last night I dr[G]eamt of San P[Am]edro
[F]Just [Am]like I'd n[C]ever gone, I [G]knew the song
[Am]A young girl with e[G]yes like the de[Am]sert
[F]It [Am]all seems like ye[C]sterday, not f[G]ar away

[Am]Tropical the i[G]sland breeze
[Dm]All of nature w[C]ild and free
[G]This is where I l[Dm]ong to be
[Dm]La isla bo[Am]nita
[Am]  And when the s[G]amba played
[Dm]  The sun would s[C]et so high
Ring [G]through my ears and [Dm]sting my eyes
Your [Em]Spanish lulla[Am]by

|[Am]/ /[G]/ /|[Am]/ / / / | x2

[Am]I fell in [G]love with San[Am]Pedro
[F]Warm win[Am]d carried o[C]n the sea, he cal[G]led to me
[Am]        Te [G]dijo te[Am]amo
[F]I pray[Am]ed that the da[C]ys would last, they we[G]nt so fast

[Am]Tropical the i[G]sland breeze
[Dm]All of nature w[C]ild and free
[G]This is where I l[Dm]ong to be
[Dm]La isla bo[Am]nita
[Am]  And when the s[G]amba played
[Dm]  The sun would s[C]et so high
Ring [G]through my ears and [Dm]sting my eyes
Your [Em]Spanish lulla[Am]by

|[Am]/ /[G]/ /|[Am]/ / / / | x2

[Dm]I want to [Bb]be where the s[C]un warms the [Dm]sky
When it's t[Dm]ime for sie[Bb]sta you can wa[C]tch them go by
[Dm]Beautiful fa[Bb]ces, no ca[C]res in this w[Dm]orld
Where a g[Dm]irl loves a b[Bb]oy, and a b[C]oy lo[E]ves a g[Am]irl
