[G]  [Bm]  [C]  [D]
[G]  [Bm]  [C]  [D]

T[G]here's a place where l[B]overs go
To c[C]ry their t[D]roubles a[G]way
[C]And they c[Cm]all it L[G]onesome T[Em]own
W[C]here the b[D]roken hearts s[G]tay ([D]Lonesome town)

Y[G]ou can buy a d[B]ream or two
To l[C]ast you al[D]l through the ye[G]ars
[C]And the on[Cm]ly price[G] you pay[Em]
I[C]s a h[D]eart full of t[G]ears

G[C]oin' down to l[Bm]onesome town
W[C]here the b[D]roken hearts s[G]tay
G[C]oin' down to [Bm]lonesome town
To [A]cry my troubles [D]away

I[G]n the town of broken d[B]reams
The [C]streets are fi[D]lled with re[G]gret
[C]Maybe down[Cm] in lone[G]some town[Em]
I[C] can learn[D] to forget[G][D]

M[C]aybe d[Cm]own in l[G]onesome t[Em]own
I[C] can l[D]earn to f[G]orget[C]
 [G](Lonesome town)
