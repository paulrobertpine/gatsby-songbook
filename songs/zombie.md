[Intro] 
Em C G D/F#  4x

[Verse 1]
Em       C                G                D/F# 
Another head hangs lowly, child is slowly taken
Em               C                    G               D/F# 
And the violence caused such silence, who are we mistaken 
        Em                        C 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
        G                               D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
           Em                              C                                                         
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns 
         G                             D/F#
in your head, in your head, they are crying

[Chorus 1]
        Em            C            G             D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G             D/F# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 

Em C G D/F# x2

[Verse 2]
Em        C                  G              D/F# 
Another mother's breaking heart is taking over
Em                C               G            D/F# 
When the violence causes silence, we must be mistaken
         Em                   C  
It's the same old theme since 1916
        G                                  D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
           Em                              C  
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
        G                            D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they're dying

[Chorus 2]
        Em            C            G             D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G             D/F# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 

[Outro]
Em C G D/F#
