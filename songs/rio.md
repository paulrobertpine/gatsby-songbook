[Em]   [C]   [A]    [C]

[Em]  Moving on the [C]floor now, babe you're a [Am7]bird of para[C]dise
[Em]  Cherry ice cream [C]smile, I sup[A]pose it's very [C]nice
With a [Em]step to your left and a [C]flick to the right
you [Am7]catch that mirror way out [C]west
[Em]  You know you're [C]something special and you [A]look like you're the [C]best[E5]

[E]  Her name is [B]Rio and she [D]dances on the [A]sand
[E]  Just like that [B]river twisting [D]though the dusty [A]land
[E]  And when she [B]shines she really [D]shows you all she [A]can
[E]  Oh Rio, [B]Rio, dance a[D]cross the Rio [A]Grande

[Em]   [C]   [Am7]    [C]
[Em]   [C]   [A]    [C]

[Em]  I've seen you on the [C]beach and I've [Am7]seen you on T[C]V
[Em]  Two[C] of a billion [A]stars,[C]  it means so [Em]much to me
[C] Like a birthda[Am7]y or a pretty v[C]iew
[Em]  But then I'm [C]sure that you [A]know it's just for [C]you[E5]

[E]  Her name is [B]Rio and she [D]dances on the [A]sand
[E]  Just like that [B]river twisting [D]through a dusty [A]land
[E]  And when she [B]shines she really [D]shows you all she [A]can
[E]  Oh Rio, [B]Rio, dance a[D]cross the Rio [A]Grande

[Em] Hey now.. woo.. [C]look at that, did she [Am7]nearly run you d[C]own
At the [Em]end of the drive the [C]lawmen arrive,
[A]you make me feel a[C]live, alive, a[Em]live
[C]  I'll take my [Am7]chance cause [C]luck is on my [Em]side or something
I [C]know what you're thinking
I [A]tell you something, I [C]know what you're think[E5]ing

[E]  Her name is [B]Rio and she [D]dances on the [A]sand
[E]  Just like that [B]river twists a[D]cross the dusty [A]land
[E]  And when she [B]shines she really [D]shows you all she [A]can
[E]  Oh Rio, [B]Rio, dance a[D]cross the Rio [A]Grande

[E]  Her name is [B]Rio, she don't [D]need to under[A]stand
[E]  And I might [B]find her if I'm [D]looking like I [A]can
[E]  Oh Rio, [B]Rio, hear them [D]shout across the [A]land
[E]  From mountains [B]in the north down [D]to the Rio [A]Grande

[E] [B][D][A][x2]

[E]   Do do d[B]o do de-do[D], Do do d[A]o do de-do
[E]   Do do d[B]o do de-do[D], Do do d[A]o do de-do
