Make me down a pallet on your floor

Make me down a pallet on your floor

Make me down a pallet soft and low

When I'm broke and I got nowhere to go



Been hanging 'round with a good-time friends of mine

Hanging around with a good-time friends of mine

Oh, they treat me very nice and kind

When I've got a dollar and a dime



We're in blues everywhere I see

We're in blues everywhere I see

We're in blues, honey, everywhere I see

No one ever had the blues like me



Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired

Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired

Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied

If I can catch that fast train and ride



So, make me down a pallet on your floor

Make me down a pallet on your floor

Make me down a pallet soft and low

Babe, I'm broke and I got nowhere to go
