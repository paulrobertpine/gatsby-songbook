[F]How [C]does it [Dm]feel
To [F]treat me [C]like you [Dm]do
When you’ve [F]laid your [C]hands upon [Dm]me
And [G]told me [C]who you [Dm]are

I [F]thought I [C]was [Dm]mistaken
I [F]thought I [C]heard your [Dm]words
Tell me [F]how [C]do I [Dm]feel
Tell me now [G]how [C]do I [Dm]feel

[F]Those who [C]came before [Dm]me
[F]Lived through [C]their vo[Dm]cations
From the [F]past un[C]til com[Dm]pletion
They will [G]turn a[C]way no [Dm]more

And I [F]still [C]find it so [Dm]hard
To [F]say what I [C]need to [Dm]say
But I’m [F]quite sure [C]that you’ll [Dm]tell me
Just how [G]I should [C]feel [Dm]today

I [F]see a [C]ship in the [Dm]harbor
I [F]can and [C]shall [Dm]obey
But if it [F]wasn’t for [C]your mis[Dm]fortunes
I’d be a [G]heavenly [C]person [Dm]today

And I [F]thought I [C]was mis[Dm]taken
And I [F]thought I [C]heard you [Dm]speak
Tell me [F]how [C]do I [Dm]feel
Tell me now [G]how [C]should I [Dm]feel

I [F]thought I [C]told you to [Dm]leave me
While I [F]walked [C]down to the [Dm]beach
Tell me [F]how [C]does it [Dm]feel
When [G]your heart [C]grows [Dm]cold
