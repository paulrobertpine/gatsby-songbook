[B5]  [G#m7]  [F#sus4]  [Esus2] x2

[B5]  My city's still[G#m7] breathing, but barely it's [F#sus4]true
Through[Esus2] buildings gone missing like t[B5]eeth
The sidewalks are[G#m7] watching me think about[F#sus4]you
[Esus2]Sparkled with broken glass
[G#m7]   I'm [F#/A#]back with [B5]scars to [E]show
[G#m7]   Back [F#/A#]with the [B5]streets I [E]know
Will[C#m/F#]never take me anywhere but here.

[B5]  [G#m7]  [F#sus4]  [Esus2] x2

[B5]  The stain in the [G#m7]carpet, this drink in my [F#sus4]hand
The [Esus2]strangers whose faces I [B5]know
We meet here for [G#m7]our dress rehearsal to [F#sus4]say
"I [Esus2]wanted it this way"
[G#m7]   Wait [F#/A#]for the [B5]year to [E]drown
[G#m7]   Spring [F#/A#]forward, [B5]fall back [E]down
I'm [C#m/F#]trying not to wonder where you [B5/G#]are.[B5/F#][B5/E]

[B5/G#] [B5/F#][B5/E]

[B5/G#]     All  [B5/F#]this   tim[B5/E]e
[B5/G#]     Lin - [B5/F#]gers   [B5/E]undefined
[B5/G#]     Should [B5/F#] one  c[B5/E]hoose
   Who's [F#]left and who's leaving

[B5]  [G#m7]  [F#sus4]  [Esus2] x2

  [B5]  Memory will [G#m7]rust and erode into [F#sus4]lists
Of [Esus2]all that you gave me[B5]
A blanket, some [G#m7]matches, this pain in my [F#sus4]chest
The [Esus2]best parts of lonely[G#m7]
Duct [F#/A#]tape and [B5]soldered [E]wires
[G#m7]New   [F#/A#]words for [B5]old de[E]sires
And [C#m/F#]every birthday card I threw away

[B5]  [G#m7]  [F#sus4]  [Esus2] x4

[G#m7]    I [F#/A#] wait  in [B5]4/4 [E]time
[G#m7]    Count [F#/A#]yellow [B5]highway [E]lines
That [C#m/F#]you're relying on to lead you [B5]home[G#m7].[F#sus4][Esus2]
That you're relying on to lead you home.
That you're relying on to lead you home.
