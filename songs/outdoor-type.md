[C]Always had a roof above me
[Am]Always paid the rent.
[C]  And I never set [Am]foot inside a tent.
[F]Couldn't build a f[G]ire to s[C]ave my l[Am]ife
I [F]lied about b[G]eing the o[F]utdoor t[C]ype

[C]And I never slept out
[Am]underneath the stars
the [C]closest that I come to that
[Am]was one time my car,
[F]  Broke down for an [G]hour in the [C]suburbs at [Am]night
I [F]lied about [G]being the [F]outdoor [C]type

[Em]To scared to [Am]let you know
I [F]knew what you've been [G]looking for
I [Em]lied until I [Am]fit the bill
God [F]bless the great ind[G]oors

I [F]lied about [G]being the o[C]utdoor [Am]type,
I've n[F]ever owned a sleeping bag let alone a mountain b[G]ike.

[C]I can't go away with you on a
[Am]Rock climbing weekend
[C]what if something's on TV and its
[Am]Never shown again
it's j[F]ust as well I'm n[G]ot invited I[C]'m afraid of [Am]heights
I l[F]ied about [G]being the [F]outdoor [C]type
[F]Never learned to s[G]wim can't grow a b[C]eard or even f[Am]ight
[F]I lied about bei[G]ng the o[F]utdo[G]or t[C]ype.
