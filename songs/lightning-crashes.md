[Intro] (Clean guitar)
[F-C-G]

[F]Lightning [C]crashes...a new mother[G]cries...
[F]Her pla[C]centa falls to the flo[G]or...
[F]The a[C]ngel opens her [G]eyes...
The confusion sets [F]in...
Before the[C] doctor can even close the[G]door...

[F]Lightning c[C]rashes...an old mother d[G]ies...
[F]Her inte[C]ntions fall to the f[G]loor...
[F]The a[C]ngel closes her e[G]yes...
The confusion that was hers[F]...
Belongs no[C]w to the baby down the h[G]all...

        [F]Oh now [C]feel it com[G]ing back again...
        Like [F]a rolling [C]thunder[G]chasing the wind...
        Force[F]s pulling[C] from the center[G]of the Earth again...
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]

[F]Lightning [C]crashes...a new mothe[G]r cries...
[F]This m[C]oment she's been waiting [G]for...
[F]The a[C]ngel opens her e[G]yes...
Pale blue colored eyes.[F]..
Presents the c[C]ircle and puts the glory out to [G]hide, hide...

        [F]Oh now f[C]eel it com[G]ing back again...
        Like [F]a rolling [C]thunder[G]chasing the wind...
        Force[F]s pulling[C] from the center[G]of the Earth again...
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]

(Am-G) (F-G) Oh I...

(Quietly)
        [F]Oh now f[C]eel it comi[G]ng back again...
        Like [F]a rolling [C]thunder[G]chasing the wind...
        Force[F]s pulling[C] from the center[G]of the Earth again...
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]

        (Loudly)
        [F]Oh now f[C]eel it comi[G]ng back again...
        Like [F]a rolling [C]thunder[G]chasing the wind...
        Force[F]s pulling[C] from the center[G]of the Earth again...
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]
        I can[F] feel i[C]t...[G]
