[Intro]
Eb Bbm Db

[Verse]
Eb           Bbm       Db      Eb             Bbm  Db
    Funny how I find myself in love with you
Eb                Bbm     Db       Eb         Bbm  Db
   If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose
    E
One half won't do

Am  F  G  C     F                     G   Am  F  G  C
       I've asked myself how much do you...
    F
Commit yourself?

 G       Am  Dm  G      C      Am   Dm  G
It's my life   don't you forget
 C       Am  Dm  G  C    Am   Dm  G  C
It's my life     it never ends

[Instrumental]
|Fm
|Eb Bbm Db

Eb           Bbm       Db    Eb       Bbm  Db
Funny how I blind myself I never knew
Eb           Bbm       Db       E
If I was sometimes played upon afraid to lose

Am  F  G  C     F                     G   Am  F  G  C
       I'd tell myself What good you do...
     F
Convince myself

 G       Am  Dm  G      C      Am   Dm  G
It's my life   don't you forget
 C       Am  Dm  G  C    Am   Dm  G  C
It's my life     it never ends

Am  F  G  C     F                     G   Am  F  G  C
       I've asked myself how much do you...
    F
Commit yourself?

[Outro]
 G       Am  Dm  G     C      Am   Dm
It's my life   don't you forget
G       C        Am  Dm  G    C    Am   Dm  G
Caught in the crowd    It never ends… (repeat last 2 lines and fade out)
