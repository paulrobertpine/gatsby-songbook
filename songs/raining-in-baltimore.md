Thi[C#m]s circus is[A] falling[B] down on its[E]knees
The [C#m]big top is [A]crumbling [B]down
It's [C#m]raining in [A]Baltimore [B]fifty miles [E]east
W[C#m]here you should be, [A]no one's [B]around

I need a [A]phone call[E]
I need a [A]raincoat[E]
I need a [A]big love[E]
I need a [A]phone call[E]

These [C#m]train conver[A]sations are [B]passing me [E]by
And I [C#m]don't have [A]nothing to [B]say
You [C#m]get what you [A]pay for but [B]I just had [E]no,
[C#m]intention, of[A] living this[B]way

I need a [A]phone call[E]
I need a [A]plane ride[E]
I need a [A]sunburn[E]
I need [A]raincoat[E]

[B]And I get no a[A]nswers
[B]And I don't get no c[A]hange
[B]It's raining in [A]Baltimore, [E]baby
[C#m]But everything [A]else is the [B]same

There's[C#m] things I rem[A]ember and [B]things I for[E]get
I [C#m]miss you I g[A]uess that I s[B]hould
[C#m]Three thousand [A]five hundred [B]miles a[E]way
But [C#m]what would you [A]change if you [B]could

I need a [A]phone call[E]
Maybe I should buy a [A]new car[E]
I can always hear a [A]freight train[E]
If I listen [A]real hard[E]
And I wish it wasn't a [A]small world[E]
'Cause I'm lonely for the [A]big towns[E]
I'd like to hear a little [A]guitar[E]
I think it's time to put the [A]top down[E]

I need a [A]phone call[E]
I need a [A]raincoat[E]
I really need a [A]raincoat[E]
I really really need a [A]raincoat[E]
I really really really need a [A]raincoat[E]
I really need a [A]raincoat[E]
