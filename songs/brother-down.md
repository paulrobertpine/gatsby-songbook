[Dm]One life to live but we're doing it wrong
You see, [C]got my brother down cause it's nothing to me[G]
[Dm]Everyone saying that it's wrong to cheat
[C]But there's no other way to get my life on easy street[G]
[Dm]Someone else telling you what you're living for
[C]Been knocking you down, now you're looking for more[G]
[Dm]The only sound you hear is a closing door
[C]Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war[G]
[Dm]Rich man cryin' cause his money's time
[C]And poor man's smilin' cause he knows he ain't blind[G]
[Dm]There's a man over there says he's tougher than me
[C]But I got eyes that can see through fantasy[G]

[Dm]I think my life is passing me by[G]
[Dm]I think my life is passing me by[G]

[Dm]Take it all back cause it don't mean nothing
[C]If you give it away and you're looking for something back[G]
[Dm]Wake up every morning when there's nothing there
[C]No reason to die but no reason to care [G]
[Dm]Someone else telling you what you're living for
[C]Been knocking you down now you're looking for more[G]
[Dm]The only sound you hear is a closing door
[C]Been looking for peace but they're bringing you war [G]
[Dm]One life to live but we're doing it wrong
[C]You see, got my brother down cause it's nothing to me[G]
[Dm]Rich man cryin' cause his money's time
[C]And poor man's smilin' cause he knows he ain't blind[G]

[Dm]I think my life is passing me by[G]
[Dm]I think my life is passing me by[G]
