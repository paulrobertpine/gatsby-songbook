[Intro]
[Am] [Em] [Dm] [Am] 
[Am] [Em] [Dm] [Am] 

[Verse 1]
[Am]If you wanna run away with [Em]me, I know a galaxy
And [Dm]I could take you for a [Am]ride
I [Am]had a premonition that we [Em]fell into a rhythm
Where the [Dm]music don't stop for [Am]life
[Am]Glitter in the sky, [Em]glitter in my eyes
[Dm]Shining just the way I [Am]like
[Am]If you're feeling like you need a [Em]little bit of company
You [Dm]met me at the perfect [Am]time


[Pre-Chorus]
[Am]  You want me,[Em]I want you, baby
[Dm]  My sugar-boo[Am], I'm levitating
[Am]  The Milky Way,[Em]we're renegading
[Dm]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, [Am]yeah


[Chorus]
I got [Am]you, [Em]moonlight, y[Dm]ou're my s[Am]tarlight
I need [Am]you [Em]all night, c[Dm]ome on dance with me[Am]

I'm levitating
I got [Am]you, [Em]moonlight, y[Dm]ou're my s[Am]tarlight

[Verse 2]
[Am]I believe that you're for me, I [Em]feel it in our energy
I [Dm]see us written in the [Am]stars
[Am]We can go wherever, so let's [Em]do it now or never
Baby, [Dm]nothing's ever ever too [Am]far
[Am]Glitter in the sky, [Em]glitter in our eyes
[Dm]Shining just the way we [Am]are
I [Am]feel like we're forever every [Em]time we get together
But [Dm]whatever, let's get lost on [Am]Mars


[Pre-Chorus]
[Am]  You want me,[Em]I want you, baby
