[E] [C#m][E][C#m]

[E]Hey, little girl is your daddy home? Did he go away and leave you all alone; [A]humm
I got a bad de[C#m]sire, [A]oh, oh, [B]oh I'm on [E]fire
Tell me now baby is he good to you and can he do to you the things that I do, oh [A]no;
I can take you [C#m]higher, [A]oh, oh, [B]oh I'm on [E]fire

[C#m] [E][C#m]

Sometimes it's like [E]someone took a knife baby, edgy and dull,
and cut a six inch valley through the [C#m]middle of my skull
At [E]night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet,
and a freight train running through the middle of my head;
only [A]you, can cool my de[C#m]sire, [A]oh, oh, [B]oh I'm on [E]fire

[A]Oh, oh, [B]oh I'm on [E]fire
[A]Oh, oh, [B]oh I'm on [E]fire

[C#m]    Hoo [E]Hoo Hoo
Hoo [C#m]Hooooooo Hoo
Hoo-oo [E]Hoo Hoo  . . . . .
