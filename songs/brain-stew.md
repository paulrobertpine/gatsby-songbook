A G F# F E x2

[A]  I'm having[G] trouble trying t[F#]o sleep[F][E]
[A]  I'm counting[G] sheep but runnin[F#]g out[F][E]
[A]  As time ticks[G]by
[F#] And still I t[F]ry[E]
[A]  No rest for[G] crosstops in m[F#]y mind

[F]On my own. [E]Here we go

A G F# F E x2

[A]  My eyes feel[G] like they're gonn[F#]a bleed[F][E]
[A]  Dried up and[G] bulging out m[F#]y skull[F][E]
[A]  My mouth is[G]dry
[F#] My face is n[F]umb[E]
[A]  F----d up and[G] spun out in m[F#]y room

[F]On my own. [E]Here we go

A G F# F E x2

[A]  My mind is[G] set on ov[F#]erdrive[F][E]
[A]  The clock is[G] laughing in m[F#]y face[F][E]
[A]  A crooked[G]spine
[F#] My sense's d[F]ulled[E]
[A]  Passed the point[G] of deli[F#]rium

[F]On my own. [E]Here we go

A G F# F E x2

[A]  My eyes feel[G] like they're gonn[F#]a bleed[F][E]
[A]  Dried up and[G] bulging out m[F#]y skull[F][E]
[A]  My mouth is[G]dry
[F#] My face is n[F]umb[E]
[A]  F----d up and[G] spun out in m[F#]y room

[F]On my own. [E]Here we go
