Oh[D], I'm Bein'followed by [G]a moon[D] shadow, [G]moonshadow, moons[D]hadow---
[D]Leapin and hoppin' on a [G]moonsh[D]adow, m[G]oonshadow, moons[D]hadow---

And [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]hands, [G]lose my [D]plough, [Em]lose my [A7]land,
Oh [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]hands, Oh [Em]if----[A7]----[D]---[Bm]-- I [Em]won't have to [A7]work no[D]more.

And [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]eyes, [G]if my [D]coloures [Em]all ran [A7]dry,
Yes [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]eyes, Oh i[Em]f----[A7]----[D]---[Bm]-- I [Em]won't have to [A7]cry no [D]more.

Oh, [D]I'm Bein'followed by a m[G]oon s[D]hadow, m[G]oonshadow, moonsh[D]adow---
[D]Leapin and hoppin' on a m[G]oonsh[D]adow, [G]moonshadow, moon[D]shadow---

And [G]if i [D]ever [G]lose my [D]legs, [G]I won't [D]moan, and [Em]I won't [A7]beg,
Yes [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]legs, Oh if[Em]-----[A7]----[D]---[Bm]-- I [Em]won't have to [A7]walk no
[D]more.

And [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]mouth, [G]all my [D]teeth, nor[Em]th and s[A7]outh,
Yes [G]if I [D]ever [G]lose my [D]mouth, Oh i[Em]f----[A7]----[D]----[Bm]-- I[Em] won't have to [A7]talk...

[E7]Did it take long to [A]find me?  [E7]I asked the faithful [A]light.
[E7]Did it take long to [A]find me?  [E7]And are you gonna stay the [A]ni---------ght?[A7]

Oh, [D]I'm Bein'followed by a [G]moon [D]shadow, [G]moonshadow, moons[D]hadow---
[D]Leapin and hoppin' on a [G]moons[D]hadow, m[G]oonshadow, moons[D]hadow-[A7]--[D]
