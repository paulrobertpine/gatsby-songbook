[Am] [G][D][Dsus4][D][Dsus2][Em]

[Am]This could be the [G]saddest dusk I've [D]ever seen[Dsus4][D][Dsus2][Em]
turn to a [Am]miracle,  [G]    high alive.[D][Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
[Em]My mind is [Am]racing,  [G]    as it al[D]ways will.[Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
My [Em]hands tired, my [Am]heart aches.
I'm [G]half a world away[D] here, [Dsus4]       [D]   [Dsus2]     my h[Em]ead sworn to [F]go it alone,
[F]and hold it along, [D]haul it along [Dsus4]      and [D]hold [Dsus4]it.[D][Dsus2]
[F]Go it alone, and hold it along.   [D]Oh.....[Dsus4].........[D]..

[Dsus4]Oh     [D]   [Dsus2]      lone[G]ly deep sit [D]hollow.[Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
[Em]Half a world, [Am]half a worl[D]d away.[G]
My [D]shoes are gone, [Dsus4]       [D]   [Dsus2]       my [Em]life spen[Am]t.[D]
I've [G]had too much to drink.[D][Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
I d[Em]idn't think, I [Am]didn't th[D]ink of you.[G]
I [D]guess that's all [Dsus4]       [D]I  [Dsus2] need-[Em]ed.
To [F]go it alone, and hold it along, [D]haul it along,[Dsus4]       and[D] hold[Dsus4] it.[D][Dsus2]
[F]Backwards, blackbirds, forwards and fall.

[Dsus4]Oh     [D]   [Dsus2]      lone[G]ly world is [D]wasted.[Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
[Em]Pathetic eyes, [Am]high al[D]ive.[G]
[D]Blind to the tide [Dsus4]       [D]  [Dsus2]      that [Em]turns the[Am] sea.[D]
This [G]storm it came up strong.[D][Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
It [Em]shook the trees and [Am]blew away o[D]ur fear.[G]
I [D]couldn't ev[Dsus4]en     [D]   [Dsus2]  hear.[Em]

To g[F]o it alone, and hold it along, [D]haul it along,[Dsus4]       and[D] hold[Dsus4] it.[D][Dsus2]
[F]Go it alone, and hold it along.   [D]Oh.....[Dsus4].........[D]..
[F]Go it alone, and hold it along, [D]haul it along,[Dsus4]       and[D] hold[Dsus4] it.[D][Dsus2]
[F]Blackbirds, backwards, forwards and fall.

[D]Oh....[Dsus4].........[D].       [Dsus4] Oh,[D][Dsus2]
[G]this could be the [D]saddest dusk[Dsus4][D][Dsus2]
I [Em]ever seen  [Am]    turn t[D]o a m[G]ira[D]cle[Dsus4],        [D]   [Dsus2]high  al[Em]ive.
[Am]My mind is [D]rac[G]ing,     [D]   [Dsus4]    as it [D]  a[Dsus2]l--way[Em]s will.
My [Am]hands tired, my h[D]ea[G]rt aches.
I'm h[D]alf a world [Dsus4]       a  [D]-   wa[Dsus2]y.[Em]

[Am]  [D]  [G]
