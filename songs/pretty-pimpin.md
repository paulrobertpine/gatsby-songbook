[Intro]

Am7 - C
Em - G - C - D


[Verse 1]

Am7
I woke up this morning
C                               Em
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
       G                  C             D
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
     Am7            C
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
              Em                  G
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
     C                   D                            Am7
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom


[Chorus]

                             C         
I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
             Em           G           C                    D
But it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
     Am7                             C                                              Em     G  C  D
Then Saturday came around and I said "Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?"

C - Am7
Em - G - C - D


[Bridge]

C                         Am      
All he ever wanted was to be someone in life that was just like
Em               G
All I want is to just have fun
C                   D
Live my life like a son of a gun
C                              Am                        Em   G  C  D
I could be one thousand miles away but still mean what I say


[Verse 2]

     Am7
Then I woke up one morning
C                               Em
Didn’t recognize the man in the mirror
       G                  C             D
Then I laughed and I said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
     Am7                C
Then I proceeded to not comb some stranger’s hair
              Em     G  C  D
Never was my style


[Chorus]

     Am7                         C                                             
But I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
                 Em           G           C                    D
Because it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
     Am7                             C                                              Em     G
Then Saturday came around and I said “Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
           C               D                           Am7      C   Em  G  C  D
But he was sporting all my clothes, I gotta say pretty pimpin


[Solo]

Am7 - C - Em - G - C - D x 2


[Bridge]

C                         Am  
All he ever wanted was to be a man
                    Em                      G                    C      D
But he was always a little too cute to be a minute under marbles lost
C                               Am                                        Em   G  C  D
He was always a thousand miles away while still standing in front of your face


[Verse 3]

     Am7
Then he woke up this morning
C                               Em
Didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
     G                C            D
Then laughed and said, “Oh silly me, that’s just me”
     Am7            C
Then I proceeded to brush some stranger’s teeth
              Em                  G
But they were my teeth, and I was weightless
     C                   D                            Am7
Just quivering like some leaf come in the window of a restroom


[Chorus]

                                 C                                             
But I couldn’t tell you what the hell it was supposed to mean
                 Em           G           C                    D
Because it was a Monday, no a Tuesday, no Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
     Am7                             C                                              Em     G
Then Saturday came around and I said “Who’s this stupid clown blocking the bathroom sink?”
           C               D                           Am7      C   Em  G  C  D
But he was sporting all my clothes, I gotta say pretty pimpin

Am7                     C                               Em        G     C     D
I woke up this morning, didn’t recognize the boy in the mirror
